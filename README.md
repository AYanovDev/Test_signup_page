# Test_signup_page

Here's a test signup page for an imaginary servise meant to better my skills at creating and editing forms. The signup page features:

1. Client-side validation of email, phone number, password and password confirmation
2. Appropriate concealment of password to maintain privacy, along with a button to verify correct spelling if necessary
3. Separate page for logging in
4. Credits with acive links to photo creators
